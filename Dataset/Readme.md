I was unable to upload the all the datasets because of the size constraints. However, the name of data sets are listed below which could be found in KAGGLE:

1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivibansal/my-dataset-1
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset (Contains 2 seperate datasets)
3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanamin/textdb3

You can use them directly in KAGGLE or download it and then upload separately.
